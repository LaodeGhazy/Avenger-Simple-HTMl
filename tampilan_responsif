				<h1> Who Is Iron Man </h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
          Iron Man, American comic book superhero, a mainstay of Marvel Comics, who first appeared in 1963 in Tales of Suspense no. 39. His creation is officially credited to four people: writer and editor Stan Lee, who plotted the first story; his brother Larry Lieber, who scripted it; artist Don Heck, who drew it; and Jack Kirby, who designed Iron Man’s original armoured battlesuit. Iron Man has appeared as the star of his own comic book series, as a regular guest in other popular comics (most notably in the The Avengers), in animated films and television series, and in live-action motion pictures.				</p>

				<h1> Iron Man Multiverse? </h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
Doctor Strange 2 is titled "In The Multiverse Of Madness," so Tom Cruise will be a different Iron Man from a different universe than Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark who recently died in The Avengers: Endgame. What's interesting is that Tom Cruise was actually up to play the MCU's Iron Man at one time as well.

According to YouTuber Grace Randolph, the rumors surrounding Tom Cruise playing Iron Man are true and Feige is trying to make it happen.				</p>
